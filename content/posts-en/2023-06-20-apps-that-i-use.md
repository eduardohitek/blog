I enjoy reading posts about the tools/apps people use in their daily lives, whether for work or personal use. I always end up discovering new tools or functionalities that I wasn't aware of. That's why I decided to create a post about the apps I use every day. The idea is to update this post every year to see how things change.

* [**iTerm2**](https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/latest): It has been my terminal of choice for macOS for years and continues to serve me well to this day. However, I have been following the development of [Rio](https://raphamorim.io/rio/), an alternative being developed by [@raphamorims](https://twitter.com/raphamorims).

* [**fish**](https://fishshell.com/): A very fast shell with various customization options to streamline daily commands. I discovered it through this [post](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/fish/) by [@caarlos0](https://twitter.com/caarlos0), where he provides more details about performance and the differences between fish and zsh. Additionally, I use some CLI utilities like [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta), [exa](https://the.exa.website/), and [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). Here's my [dotfiles](https://github.com/eduardohitek/dotfiles.fish) for fish.

* [**Arc**](https://arc.net/): The new favorite when it comes to browsers. It has a contextual tab organization feature based on your usage, which helps separate work-related and personal items. It's worth taking a look. If you need an invitation, just let me know.

* [**Shottr**](https://shottr.cc/): A tool for taking screenshots and sharing them with others. It offers more functionality than the native macOS tool and is much lighter than [Skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch).

* [**Rectangle**](https://rectangleapp.com/): A handy tool for organizing windows on macOS. In my case, as I use two monitors, it's very helpful when I need to move apps from one screen to another or when I want to arrange windows side by side. It offers various shortcut options and configurations to suit your window management needs.

* [**Alfred**](https://www.alfredapp.com/): A well-known replacement for the native Spotlight. It's a productivity tool that I use to open apps, search for files, execute commands, etc. The free version is already quite useful, but the paid version brings more functionality and integrations with other apps.

* [**CopyClip**](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/copyclip-clipboard-history/id595191960?mt=12): A lifesaver with clipboard history. I use it a lot for copying and pasting texts that I need to use in multiple places. You can define how many items you want it to store in the history and set shortcuts for frequently used items.

* [**Cron**](https://cron.com/download/macos): An alternative to the native macOS calendar application. It has a cleaner and simpler interface to use. There is also an iOS version that syncs with macOS.

* [**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/): A well-known tool responsible for various courses on Udemy :) I use it to organize my studies, take notes and create my [bragdoc](https://eltonminetto.dev/post/2022-04-14-brag-document/).

* [**Zed**](https://zed.dev/): A text editor that I am currently testing and using to write this post. It provides a more minimalist and clean approach without relying on many extensions, with built-in features such as Github Copilot, LSP, and live collaboration.
